# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica, based on their physical attributes. By leveraging various machine learning techniques, we aim to build a predictive model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers. The project follows a structured workflow from data exploration and preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the well-known Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample includes four features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

Each sample is labeled with one of the three species:

Iris-setosa

Iris-versicolor

Iris-virginica

The dataset is provided in the IRIS.csv file.

Task Objectives
Understand and explore the Iris dataset.

Preprocess the data to ensure it is clean and ready for modeling.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Select the best model based on performance metrics.

Visualize the results using PCA.

Approach
1. Data Exploration
Objective: Understand the dataset and identify any potential issues or patterns.

Loading the Dataset: Import the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure and contents.

Summary Statistics: Generate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for each feature to get an overview of the data distribution.

Data Visualization: Use various plots to visualize relationships between features and the distribution of each species:

Scatter Plots: Visualize pairwise relationships between features to identify any potential correlations.

Pair Plots: Create pair plots to visualize the distribution of features for each species.

Box Plots: Use box plots to understand the spread and identify any outliers in the data.

2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the data for machine learning models by cleaning and transforming it.

Handling Missing Values: Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them appropriately. In this case, if there are missing values, we can use techniques like imputation or removing rows/columns with missing values.

Feature Scaling: Standardize the features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial for models like KNN and SVM that are sensitive to the scale of the input features.

Encoding Categorical Variables: Encode the target variable (species) using label encoding to convert the categorical labels into numeric values that machine learning algorithms can understand.

3. Model Selection
Objective: Train and select the best machine learning model for classification.

Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (70% training and 30% testing) to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Model Training: Train several machine learning models, including:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple and effective algorithm that classifies samples based on their nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes.

Decision Trees: A versatile algorithm that builds a tree-like model based on feature splits to classify samples.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to find the best model parameters. For example, in the KNN model, we tune the number of neighbors (k) to find the optimal value that maximizes accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models based on several metrics, including:

Accuracy: The overall correctness of the model.

Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among the total positive predictions.

Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among the total actual positive samples.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance.

4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Objective: Reduce the dimensionality of the data for visualization purposes.

Dimensionality Reduction: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data to two principal components. PCA helps in visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space while retaining important information.

Visualization: Plot the data in the reduced PCA space to visualize the separation between different species. This helps in understanding how well the species can be separated based on features.

Challenges Faced
Handling Missing Values: Ensuring that any missing values in the dataset are handled appropriately to avoid negatively impacting model performance.

Feature Scaling: Properly scaling features to improve the performance of distance-based algorithms like KNN and SVM.

Model Selection: Choosing the best model among multiple options and tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.

Visualizing High-Dimensional Data: Using PCA to effectively visualize high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.

Results
Final Model: The final model selected is a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with the optimal number of neighbors determined through cross-validation. The model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set.

Evaluation Metrics
Confusion Matrix: Display the confusion matrix to show true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts. This helps in understanding the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

Classification Report: Provide a detailed classification report with precision, recall, and F1-score for each species. These metrics help in understanding the model's performance for each class.

Visualization
PCA Plot: Visualize the actual vs predicted species in the PCA-reduced space to evaluate the model's performance visually. This helps in understanding how well the model is able to separate the different species in the reduced space.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for classifying Iris flowers. The KNN model with hyperparameter tuning provided the best performance, and the use of PCA allowed for effective visualization of the classification results.
